---------BackEnd

npm init
npm i express dotenv mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cookie-parser express-async-handler

// express-async-handler is a middleware (In Express.js, middleware functions are used to handle HTTP requests before they reach their final endpoint (route handler). Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, data validation) 

npm i -D nodemon

//here -D means install as devDependencies

------To use import syntax we will use ES6 module 

Simple go to your package.jsona and add
{
"name" : "yourProjectName",
"type" :"module"
}

// dotenv

NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000

// In server.js 
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Server is ready"));
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`The server is running on port ${port}`));


// The primary purpose of using a dotenv file is to separate sensitive or configurable information from your codebase.
Security: Some configuration values, like passwords, access tokens, or API keys, should not be stored directly in the source code. By using a dotenv file, you keep these sensitive pieces of information separate from the codebase and prevent accidental exposure through version control systems or code reviews.

//------------POSTMAN
You can simply open postman and start sending request but we can also do something like below:

create new Workspace and save as collection
create new collection rename it as you want
create new Env variable and set
baseURL to http://localhost:5000/api

now go to your workspace and send a post request as

{{basURL}}/users/auth

you should get this message 
{
    "message": "Auth User"
} 

**TIP**:
This would be convenient for you if you would add each request for your routes in your collection. This would make easier for you later on to get data etc. 

-----------------handling error
we dont want to use JS default error handler we will create our own custom error handler
it will do 2 jobs
1. for routes not found
2. for errors inside the existing routes
so create a middleware folder inside the backend
and create and errorMiddleware.js file

// In errorMiddleware.js 
const notFound = (req, res, next) => {
  const error = new Error(`Not Found - ${req.originalUrl}`);
  res.status(404);
  next(error);
};

const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  let statusCode = res.statusCode === 200 ? 500 : res.statusCode;
  let message = err.message;
  if (err.name === "CastError" && err.kind === "ObjectId") {
    statusCode = 404;
    message = "Resource not found";
  }
  res.status(statusCode).json({
    message: message,
    stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? null : err.stack,
  });
};

export {notFound, errorHandler}

-----How to use this errorMiddleware file
simple go to your parent file called server.js
// In server.js

import { notFound, errorHandler } from "./middlerware/errorMiddleware.js";
app.use(notFound)
app.use(errorHandler)


IMPORTANT:
your sever file is connected with routes file (which contains all the routes) and your routes file is connected with 
controller file which contains all the logic happeding inside routes defined in routes.js
Moreover, since we have created errorMiddleware file and we have connected it with server.js file so its will check for 
errors not only in server.js but also in routes.js and controller.js as well.

you can test your errorMiddleware by intentionally thorwing an error inside your controller function as
  
  const authUser = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {

  res.status(401);
  throw new Error('Something went wrong')

  res.status(200).json({ message: "Auth User" });
});

now send request from postman we must see your custom error

---------------Connecting to DB

https://mongoosejs.com/docs/


create a folder called config inside that create a file called db.js
first of all go to the monogodb wesite create a data base and connect it by clicking on drivers get the db url 
and paste it into your env folder. 

// In db.js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI) 
    console.log(`MongoDB connected: ${conn.connectoin.host}`)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`)
    process.exit(1);

  }
}
export default connectDB;

// Now go to your server.js file
import connectDB from "./config/db.js";
connectDB();

// output should be: MongoDB connected: ac-2md2mgj-shard-00-00.bhvqplp.mongodb.net

Now create a folder called model and create a file inside it called userModel
This file will contain our schemas and model
Moreover you will hash you password in this file


----Creating secret key:
you can create this SECRET_KEY using this command in terminal
require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')

-----running both frontend and backend at the same terminal
npm install -D concurrently

run this command not in frontend terminal but in the root terminal e.g mern_authentication in this case.

now go to your package.json file and add the below code in your script tag
"scripts" : {
...
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"" 
...
}


---------cleaning up vite set up files in frontend
delete App.css
clean code in App.jsx and replace yours
clean index.css
